# Input Sanitization.

When developing a secure web app, one of the most critical steps is sanitizing user inputs. Think of user inputs  like search bars, forms, or APIs ,as doorways into your application. Without proper sanitization, you're leaving those doors wide open. Any point where users can send data into your system represents a potential attack vector.

## Why Input Sanitization Matters
Even with strong defenses like firewalls and encryption in place, the application code itself often remains the weakest link. An unchecked input field can expose the system to serious threats like SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and other vulnerabilities

Take this as an example: if inputs aren't sanitized, attackers can inject malicious scripts that steal cookies or fool users into phishing traps. 


## What is Input Sanitization?
Also known as 'data sanitization',it is process of cleaning or modifying potentially harmful user-provided data to make it safe for processing or storage. Sanitization ensures that data from all sources such as forms, file uploads etc. as we mentioned earlier is verified, cleaned, and made secure before being handled by your system.
## Validation vs. Sanitization

Validation checks that user input matches the expected format, such as ensuring an email address is in the correct format or a number is within a certain range. Validation verifies that the data is correct. On the other hand, sanitization cleans and modifies the data to ensure it’s safe to process or store. This process removes malicious code or any unsafe content.

## Key Benefits of Input Sanitization:
1. **Prevents Malicious Code Execution**: Input sanitization ensures that any harmful code in user inputs is neutralized before it can be executed, protecting your system from exploitation.
2. **Protects Data Integrity:** By filtering out invalid or malicious data, sanitization preserves the integrity of the data stored within your system, ensuring that only valid information is processed.
 
3. **Safeguards Against Exploits:** It acts as a defense mechanism against common attacks such as SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Command Injection, minimizing potential vulnerabilities.
4. **Maintains User Trust:** A well-secured web app protects your users and maintains the trust they've placed in your platform, safeguarding your reputation in the process.


## **Common Attacks Prevented by Input Sanitization**
**1. SQL Injection**

SQL Injection allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database. This can allow an attacker to view data that they are not normally able to retrieve.Without sanitization, malicious users could manipulate database queries, resulting in unauthorized data access, deletion, or modification.

Example of an Unsanitized SQL Query:

```js
const userInput = req.body.username;  // User-provided input
const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '${userInput}' AND password = '${req.body.password}'`;  // Vulnerable query
db.query(query, function(err, result) {
    // Handle result
});

```
If an attacker submits `'admin' OR 1=1 --` as the username, the query becomes:
- **Password**: (any value)

The resulting query becomes:
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' OR 1=1 --' AND password = 'anypassword';
```
This will bypass authentication, letting the attacker log in without a password.

**2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

XSS attacks occur when an attacker injects malicious scripts into a website's content. These scripts execute in the user's browser, potentially allowing the attacker to steal sensitive data like session cookies, redirect users to harmful websites, or manipulate the displayed information.



Example of an Unsanitized Output:


```js
const userComment = req.body.comment;
res.send(`<div class="comment">${userComment}</div>`);
```
If the user inputs a script like
```html
<script>alert('XSS');</script>

```
The script will be executed in the browser, triggering an alert box.Your server blindly includes it in the HTML response.When another user loads the page, the script executes in their browser.

## How to Sanitize User Input
1. **Sanitizing Input with Regular Expressions**
One common approach to sanitization is using regular expressions to validate and clean inputs. For example, ensuring a username only contains alphanumeric characters:

Example:


```js
function sanitizeUsername(username) {
    return username.replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9]/g, ''); // Removes any non-alphanumeric characters
}


const sanitizedUsername = sanitizeUsername(req.body.username);
```
In this example, we remove any non-alphanumeric characters from the username input.

2. **Using the escape() Function for XSS Prevention**
To protect against XSS, you can use an escape function to prevent potentially dangerous characters from being executed in the browser.

Example:

```js
function sanitizeInput(input) {
    return input.replace(/[&<>"'/]/g, function(match) {
        const escapeMap = {
            '&': '&amp;',
            '<': '&lt;',
            '>': '&gt;',
            '"': '&quot;',
            "'": '&#39;',
            '/': '&#x2F;',
        };
        return escapeMap[match];
    });
}

const sanitizedComment = sanitizeInput(req.body.comment);
res.send(`<div class="comment">${sanitizedComment}</div>`);
```
This function escapes common special characters to prevent any HTML or JavaScript from executing when the comment is displayed in the browser.



3. **SQL Query Parameterization**
Rather than directly embedding user input into SQL queries, it’s best to use parameterized queries. This approach helps protect against SQL injection attacks by treating user input as data, not executable code.


```SQL
const query = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?';
db.query(query, [req.body.username], function(err, result) {
    // Handle result
});
```
In this example, the ``?`` acts as a placeholder for user input, ensuring the data is safely handled and not executed as part of the query.

## Best Practices for Input Sanitization
#### Validate Input: 
Before sanitizing, validate that input data matches the expected format (e.g., email, number, date).

#### Whitelist Input:
Only accept what is necessary for your application. If the input should only be an email, for instance, validate that it’s a properly formatted email address.
#### Use HTTP Security Headers:
In addition to input sanitization, consider implementing HTTP security headers such as Content-Security-Policy (CSP) to mitigate risks of XSS. CSP helps prevent the execution of malicious scripts by restricting the sources from which content can be loaded.

#### Use Existing Libraries:
Leverage well-established libraries and frameworks for sanitization and validation, like validator.js or DOMPurify.

#### Sanitize Output:
Don’t just sanitize input ,always sanitize output that will be rendered in the browser to prevent XSS.

#### Regular Security Audits:
Continuously audit and test your codebase for vulnerabilities, especially as new attack techniques emerge.
### Key Takeaways

- **Never trust user input.** Always assume all data is potentially malicious.
- **Strengthen security with multiple layers.** Combine various defensive techniques to enhance protection and reduce vulnerabilities.
- **Use parameterized queries** to prevent SQL injection.
- **Validate and sanitize all inputs** on both the client and server sides.
- **Implement proper error handling** to avoid exposing sensitive data.
- **Keep libraries and frameworks up to date** to minimize vulnerabilities.

**Conclusion**

Sanitizing user inputs is crucial for protecting web applications from attacks like SQL injection and XSS. By validating inputs and using security best practices, you can reduce vulnerabilities and keep your app safe.
